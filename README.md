Crunchyroll filter systems are very limited and don't allow you to combine matches to discover new animes, this repository is dedicated to helping you explore your possibilities.

## Crawler

We're following the sitemap in [robots.txt](https://www.crunchyroll.com/robots.txt) to get all public information provided by Crunchyroll and we're limited by that. 

## Web Application

We're developing a web interface using flask to make it more friendly to non-technical people. Run it using `flask run`. 

## Contribution

Feel free to help us with this project, especially in CSS :D
